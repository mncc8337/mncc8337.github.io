        <h2>what</h2>
        <p><a href="github.com/0x5e8">we</a> decided to make a game about growing mold, called Mold Control (what a name).</p>

        <h2>the game</h2>
        <p>the goal of the game would be becoming the mother of mold: collecting all species of mold and all infomation about them. it may sounds brizzare but i think it may be interesting. we got this idea because we have been making cheese recently, and one of the important processes of it is getting good mold to grow on the cheese, developing new flavour. we extended this idea to growing all type of mold to get money to grow our own mold company!</p>
        <p>the game will feature a grid placing system. all the building need to be placed manually and must be linked by some ways to get them to work. there would be a lab to research, a farm to grow mold, power generator, and so on. these building can be upgraded from tier 1 to 5 to improve their productivity. there are also some decorative like trees, poles, pavements to decorate the farm</p>
        <p>it would be pretty boring if there are no special events, so i think it need some kind of natural disaster like mold spread, breeze or flaming weather, etc. or maybe some kind of special mold that only appear in a specific amount of time like luminescense mold? if i want to implement all of these i would probably need a datetime system and a day-night cycle.</p>
        <p>i hope this project will be complete (and not being dumped into dumpster like my other projects lol)</p>
